SEN PROJECT 4: API DOCUMENTATION


/** 
!To be Removed!

Nk is currently working on:
a lot of things, oh no scope creep. thats why im writing it down.


	I need to write code so Succesful sign up updates the database.

	I want the alert that you got some login wrong or something to show on the hmtl. like the text boxes going red.
	that requires a streamwriter i think, to write CSS to the HTML.
	
	Hashing of passwords so they can be hidden in the database

 	Dynamically generated CSS files that change depending on certain info. (could have different colour schemes for the app depending on user)

Why we used the Twilio API
We decided to use the Twilio external API.
The Twilio API is a restful API. 
Reasons why we decided on a restful API:
•	Generally, RESTful APIs are easier to understand and uses standard HTTP methods.
•	Since RESTful API’s are know to be stateless, each request is independent from other interactions of the previous state.
•	The RESTful API is easier in terms of data format. While the most common format is JSON, the API can handle multiple different formats, such as HTML and plain text.
•	REST API’s have lower overhead and are thus generally faster.
•	Since REST API’s use standard HTTP methods and status codes, this makes it a lot easier to integrate with the system.
•	REST API’s  support standard HTTP-based security features, such at OAuth for authentication.
•	REST API’s indicates the success or failure of a request with HTTP status codes.
•	REST is stateless, thus it enhances reliability since the system does not need to recover between each transaction.
What does the API do
On the website  https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/tutorials/how-to-use-your-free-trial-account-namer information can be found on how to use this API, in a short:
•	Twilio provides you with a free unique Twilio number that you can use for your messages. 
•	On this website you will have a dashboard you can use to send messages and view your authentication token as well as your SID
•	Using the authentication token and SID the website provides you with an example snippet of the code that you can use(Seen bellow)
 
 
•	 Since we are building in java, we extracted the java snippet and integrated it into our code.
How is the API integrated
The API uses a callback function that checks the job table to see if any jobs have a job status of unassigned. If it sees a job with no assignment, the API is initiated and all the unassigned technicians are sent a text message(Due to Twilio verification restrictions, and a lack of time to apply, the API only sends text to a virtual number hosted by Twilio)
